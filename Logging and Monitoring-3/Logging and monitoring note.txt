monitoring service such as metrics server, prometheus. proprietary solutions etastic stack, datadog, dynatrace

heapster was one of the original projects that enabled monitoring and analysis features for kubernetes (deprecated). Now, metric server	

the metric server is only an in memory monitoring solution and does not store the metrics on the desk and as a result you cannot see historical performace data.

kubernetes run an agent on node known as kubelet which is responsible for receiving instructions from the kubernetes API master server and running PODs on the nodes.
the kubelet also contains a subcomponent known as a 'cAdvisor' or 'Container Advisor'
-cAdvisor responsible for retrieving performance metrics from pods, and exposing them through the kubelete API to make the metrics available for the Metrics Server.

for minikube (local)
-> minikube addons enable metrics-server
-> git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-serve
-> kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/
for view -> kubectl top node		//view node
  	    kubectl top pods		//view pods

demo
-> git clone https://github.com/kodekloudhub/kubernetes-metrics-server.git && cd kubernetes-metrics-server && kubectl create -f .
